This was a project that I did for CBSE National Science Exhibition while in school, 
it was one of the winning projects in competition.

* At that time I just started exploring linux, so linux support pretty much basic.

** The BUZZ program shortcut on the desktop doesn't work out of the 
box, this happens due to wrong set Active directory of the program..
change it through, right click >> start in director >> "set it to installed directory"

or you could use the application from the installed directory.

1) Open intro.hta : the setup menu for the program

2) Click "Setup iCruzer", follow on screen intruction to install program

	the setup program will install required dependecies, shared resources
	etc, in backgroud it will fork the vcredist_x86.exe : the standard 
	c\c++ runtime component installer,

	The program will also add a windows shell extension for .RCZ extension

	At last the program will copy the required files to the setup directory
	and will execute the iCruzer configurer "config.exe", this will
	install or execute the SAPI 5.1 redistributables, actually through
	executing respective SAPI MSM , windows Merge modules.

3) Finish the setup...

Due to continued developing and testing...the setup of the program may be old
in that case copy the file in the "UPDATE" folder to the setup directory.

The folder "linux" includes the linux binaries for the linux platform...
Due to time constraint complete port of the program for the linux
platform isn't avaialble...
although, the linux port includes the core things, the project uses
this includes the icruzer i386 linux driver, rcz, buzz, irover....

* Voice recognition may not be too reliable, you need to train the software more.
The more you train, the better the reliability.
