right : - Moves right

RCZ : Raja Cruzer script/programming language is the scripting/programming
language that can be used to program cruzer and similar projects.
Following is the structure of the RCZ file. RCZ is an pure text file.
Example of a RCZ file :-

RCZ 1.0 ; first line defines the header and version information of RCZ
; This is a sample for Raja CruZer (RCZ) scripting/programming language

DEBUG 1 
PRINT Welcome to raja networks lexor testing
PRINT Program will tend to move robot :-

FORWARD ; forward command
BACKWARD ; backward command
LEFT ; left 
RIGHT ; right

WAIT 500 ; waits for 500 milli seconds
PRINT Closing application

; Below, a sample for looping
LIMIT 2
PRINT This is a loop
INC 0 1
LOOP

ADDR 1 100
LIMIT 50
